=CloudKit

CloudKit is an Open Web JSON Appliance.

More specifically, CloudKit provides RESTful JSON storage with optional OpenID and OAuth support, including OAuth Discovery. Stored entities are versioned. Services manage their own storage and do not require schema updates when models change.

CloudKit is Rack middleware and as such can be used on its own or alongside other Rack-based applications or middleware components like Rails, Merb or Sinatra.

===Install

  gem install cloudkit

===Examples

In a rackup file called config.ru:

  require 'cloudkit'
  expose :notes, :todos

The above creates a versioned HTTP service using JSON to represent two types of resource collections -- Notes and ToDos.

In a different rackup file:

  require 'cloudkit'
  contain :notes, :todos

The above provides the same API as example 1 with added authentication and authorization via OpenID and OAuth, respectively.

An explicit version of example 2, minus the default developer landing page:

  require 'cloudkit'
  use Rack::Pool::Session
  use CloudKit::OAuthFilter
  use CloudKit::OpenIDFilter
  use CloudKit::Service, :collections => [:notes, :todos]
  run lambda {|env| [200, {'Content-Type' => 'text/html'}, ['HELLO']]}

The same as above, using MySQL:

  require 'cloudkit'
  use Rack::Config do |env|
    env[CLOUDKIT_STORAGE_URI] = 'mysql://user:pass@localhost/cloudkit_example'
  end
  use Rack::Pool::Session
  use CloudKit::OAuthFilter
  use CloudKit::OpenIDFilter
  use CloudKit::Service, :collections => [:notes, :todos]
  run lambda {|env| [200, {'Content-Type' => 'text/html'}, ['HELLO']]}
