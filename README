=CloudKit

CloudKit is an Open Web JSON Appliance.

CloudKit provides schema-free, auto-versioned, RESTful JSON storage with optional OpenID and OAuth support, including OAuth Discovery.

CloudKit is Rack middleware. It can be used on its own or alongside other Rack-based applications or middleware components like Rails, Merb or Sinatra.

===Install

  gem install cloudkit

===Examples

In a rackup file called config.ru:

  require 'cloudkit'
  expose :notes, :todos

The above creates a versioned HTTP/REST service using JSON to represent two types of resource collections -- Notes and ToDos.

In a different rackup file:

  require 'cloudkit'
  contain :notes, :todos

The above provides the same API as example 1 with added authentication and authorization via OpenID and OAuth, respectively.

An explicit version of example 2, minus the default developer landing page:

  require 'cloudkit'
  use Rack::Session::Pool
  use CloudKit::OAuthFilter
  use CloudKit::OpenIDFilter
  use CloudKit::Service, :collections => [:notes, :todos]
  run lambda {|env| [200, {'Content-Type' => 'text/html', 'Content-Length' => '5'}, ['HELLO']]}

The same as above, using Tokyo Cabinet:

  require 'cloudkit'
  require 'rufus/tokyo' # gem install rufus-tokyo
  CloudKit.setup_storage_adapter(Rufus::Tokyo::Table.new('cloudkit.tdb'))
  use Rack::Session::Pool
  use CloudKit::OAuthFilter
  use CloudKit::OpenIDFilter
  use CloudKit::Service, :collections => [:notes, :todos]
  run lambda {|env| [200, {'Content-Type' => 'text/html', 'Content-Length' => '5'}, ['HELLO']]}
