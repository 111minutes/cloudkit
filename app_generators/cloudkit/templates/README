Welcome to CloudKit

CloudKit provides a framework for building synchronized Open Web applications that run in and out of the browser, online and offline, using technologies like OpenID, OAuth, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and REST web services.

Server components run under the fast and furious Sinatra/Thin combo. Client apps run using the only available HTML wrapper with cross-platform client side SQL storage at this time, Adobe AIR. Open alternatives to AIR will be enthusiastically supported when they become available. With the recent implementation of HTML 5 Storage in WebKit, and the release of Mozilla Prism, alternatives are within reach.
