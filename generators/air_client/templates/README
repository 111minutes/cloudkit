 Your desktop AIR client knows when it has connectivity to your web service and
 adjusts its behavior accordingly. It also automatically migrates its local
 SQLite schema to match the web service models.
 
 To test immediately:
 
 > rake air:debug
 
 Then, package and publish the app:
 
 > rake air:package
 
 You can continually publish major, minor, and patch releases like this:
 
 > rake air:package:major
   or
 > rake air:package:minor
   or
 > rake air:package:patch
